# Face-Blur-App


## Project Summary:

The proposed project aims to enhance user privacy and security during video calls on platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp by implementing real-time face detection and blurring. In recent times, there have been increasing incidents of scammers creating fake profiles, engaging in video calls, and recording inappropriate content. To combat this issue, this project offers users the option to enable face detection and automatic blurring during video calls with unknown or untrusted contacts. By integrating computer vision technology, the system can detect faces and apply real-time blurring to protect users' identities and privacy. This proactive approach empowers users to avoid falling victim to scams involving recorded video content.
